# A trial implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron with the tensorflow Sequential model. 
Uses integer encoded class labels (instead of 1hot encoded).

Shows the order of operations during the data preprocessing stage to achieve feature encoding during model training and not before (which I was struggling with).

Utilizes my neat plot_history() function.
